# dotfiles

The files in this repo are dotfiles for some of my favorite programs. They are mainly for my use but if someone wants to use them that is fine. 


The "startstump" file is what is used to start stumpwm with SBCL, so that you can use Emacs and Slime to debug/modify the window manager live (while it's running).
