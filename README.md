# dotfiles

## General
The files in this repo are dotfiles for some of my favorite
programs. They are mainly for my use but if someone wants to use them
that is fine.

The "startstump" file is what is used to start stumpwm with SBCL, so
that you can use Emacs and Slime to debug/modify the window manager
live (while it's running).

Also, note that the xinitrc file is specifically for when using EXWM
yet contains commented items for StumpWM and DWM.

mpv-config needs to get placed in the $HOME/.mpv/ directory under the
named `config' to work correctly.
